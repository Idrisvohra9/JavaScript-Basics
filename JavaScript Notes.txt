JavaScript is a really powerful language and it makes it possible to embed Html documents with functionality.

JavaScript is is also used in front-end as well as in back-end it has many awsome libraries such as Node.js and React.js
* Node.js is a runtime environment used or developing a server side programming

In javascript variables are declared using 4 methods:
1. Using var keyword,
2. Using let keyword,
3. Using const keyword,
4. Using nothing (Not recommended!).

Finding errors are kinda hard in javascript.
int and float data types are just called numbers.
variable names can have a dollar sign or even a dollar sign can become a variable.WTF

JavaScript has sttupid string and int conversion rules such as these:
5 + null    // returns 5         because null is converted to 0
"5" + null  // returns "5null"   because null is converted to "null"
"5" + 2     // returns "52"      because 2 is converted to "2"
"5" - 2     // returns 3         because "5" is converted to 5
"5" * "2"   // returns 10        because "5" and "2" are converted to 5 and 2
