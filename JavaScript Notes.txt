JavaScript is loosely typed language but it makes it possible to embed Html documents with functionality.

In javascript variables are declared using 4 methods:
1. Using var keyword,
2. Using let keyword,
3. Using const keyword,
4. Using nothing.

Finding errors are extremely hard in javascript.
int and float data types are just called numbers.
variable names can have a dollar sign or even a dollar sign can become a variable.WTF

JavaScript has sttupid string and int conversion rules such as these:
5 + null    // returns 5         because null is converted to 0
"5" + null  // returns "5null"   because null is converted to "null"
"5" + 2     // returns "52"      because 2 is converted to "2"
"5" - 2     // returns 3         because "5" is converted to 5
"5" * "2"   // returns 10        because "5" and "2" are converted to 5 and 2

.innerHTML can only be used when we getElementById.
