        4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
        Using var
        Using let
        Using const
        Using nothing
        */
        /*
        When to Use JavaScript var?
    Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, or const.

    The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

    The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

    If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var.
    */
    /*
        When to Use JavaScript const?
    If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.

    If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.

    In this example, price1, price2, and total, are variables:

*/
// The two variables n1 and n2 are declared with the const keyword.
const n1=10, n2=20;
document.write('n1 = '+n1+" n2 = "+n2,'<br>');
// These are constant values and cannot be changed.
// n1=50;
// The variable total is declared with the let keyword.

// This is a value that can be changed.
