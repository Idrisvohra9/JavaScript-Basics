// A map is similar to Objects as in it also stores data in key-value pairs.

// But in a Map the key can be of any data type.

// A map remembers the original insertion order of the keys.

// A map has a property that represents the size of the map.

// It can be directly iterable unlike Objects.

// Keys in Maps are ordered by their creation time.

// Do not have defalut keys.
